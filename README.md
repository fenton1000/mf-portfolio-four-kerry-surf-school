# Portfolio Project 4 - Kerry Surf School README

## 1. Purpose of the Project

Kerry Surf School is a small owner-run business teaching surfing lessons and hiring out surfing equipment. The business currently has an online presence via its social media accounts and through a Google Business Profile but it does not have its own website. Most of the surfing lessons are booked over the phone without a requirement to pay when booking. Payments are taken in person on the day of the lesson. Walk-ins are also accepted for lessons if room is available. The majority of equipment hire customers are walk-in customers.

Now the business has decided to create its own website in the hope of increasing business volumes. The business would like to have two key elements initially. Firstly it would like to provide information on the services it currently provides. Secondly it would like to have an option for potential customers to book its most popular beginner-level and intermediate-level lessons online. To begin with, the business is happy to allow customers book online and pay on the day of the lesson as this is how it already manages phone bookings.

Assuming that the creation of the website leads to benefits for the business, Kerry Surf School would envisage adding additional features to the website over time. These include the ability to book a range of equipment/clothing, to book more advanced lessons with or without equipment and to book private lessons. Futhermore, it would like to eventually have the option to process payments online.

Finally, as a longer term business goal, Kerry Surf School has begun researching the possibility of selling surfing equipment. If it decides at some point in the future to commence equipment sales, it sees online sales as a likely key aspect of such a strategy.

## 2. User Stories - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. As a **Visiting User** I can **view information about the lessons available** so that **I can determine whether the business provides the surf lesson I require.**

2. As a **Visiting User** I can **view information about the equipment available to rent** so that **I can determine whether the business provides the equipment I need.**

3. As a **Visiting User** I can **view contact information for the business** so that **I can call or email the business to make enquires or bookings.**

4. As a **Visiting User** I can **book standard lesson type options online** so that **I can go online at a time convenient to me and make a booking.**

5. As a **Visiting User** I can **view my bookings online** so that **I can go online at any time convenient to me to confirm the details of any bookings I have made.**

7. As a **Visiting User** I can **cancel my bookings online** so that **I can go online at any time convenient to me and cancel some or all of the bookings I have made.**

8. As a **Visiting User** I can **receive onscreen confirmation messages for actions such as making a booking** so that **I can be confident I have successfully completed the required task.**

9. As a **Visiting User** I can **add more of my details to my customer profile** so that **I do not need to re-enter them for every booking.**

10. As a **Visiting User** I can **include any special requests with my booking** so that **I do not need to contact the business again having already submitted a booking.**

11. As a **Site Admin** I can **approve bookings with a system visible on the admin side only** so that **I can monitor booking volumes against my available staff resources on any given day and review any special requests.**

12. As a **Site Admin** I can **view and filter bookings** so that **I can plan for expected customer volumes.**

13. As a **Site Admin** I can **amend bookings** so that **in the event of any particular problem arising such as a lack of available staff, bookings can be adjusted in consultation with customers.**

14. As a **Site Admin** I can **prevent an individual student booking themselves into the same lesson more than once** so that **I do not end up with accidental spurious bookings.**

15. As a **Business Owner** I can **provide a website landing page to potential customers that clearly defines the business offering** so that **I can attract potential customers to view further detailed information on the services offered so as to potentially increase business volumes.**

* This form contains the same fields and format as the create customer profile form.

* When the link is clicked and the form is opened, the form is pre-populated with the current customer profile data.

### 3.14 Admin Log In Page - Customization

* This page contains one customized link, a Back to Home link to take users back to the home page if they click on the Admin Only link.

* Otherwise, this is a standard Django Admin-provided page template providing a log in form that only allows log in with an admin password.

### 3.15 Admin Bookings List Display - Customization

* In general the features provided on the admin side are the default Django-provided features. However, the Bookings list display from the Booking model is customized.

* An approval process is added whereby bookings default to not approved until the admin approves them. This is to allow the admin to control booking volumes and intervene if a problem arises. The system is coded to automatically prevent an individual from double-booking themselves. However, because these are group lessons multiple bookings at the same time by different individuals are allowed. Consideration was given to coding in an upper limit on bookings for any given lesson but doing this would lead to other issues arising. Firstly, from a customer viewpoint, if a booking is refused due to business volumes the system should suggest alternatives. Failure to provide alternatives is considered a poor UX. However, this level of sophistication does not form part of the MVP but could be considered as a future feature. Secondly, the business already expects and caters to different business volumes throughout the weeks and seasons. Therefore setting a single upper limit is not a viable solution. Again a more sophisticated solution allowing the admin to set limits for specific time periods or lessons could be considered as a future feature. The downside of the current solution is that in the event of too many bookings the business will have to contact individuals and manually adjust bookings. However, given that this is a small but established business that already has a reasonably good idea of expected volumes and typically can cater for this, it does not anticipate significant issues for now. If business volumes grow, the future features described above can be added.

* The booking display list includes the customer first name and the name is also a link to the customers details in the related customer model. When the business is using the booking list in a practical use scenario such as preparing equipment for a particular lesson, easy access to the customer profile is very useful rather than having to search for the customer for each booking in the seperate customer model.

* The ability to filter the booking list by date and approval status is added. In particular, the date filters are customized to provide a more useful set of filters for management of bookings, than the default Django date filters. For example Django includes defaults of "last 7 days" and "this year" whereas "next 7 days" and "remainder of this year" are considered more useful in this scenario.

* The list includes the customer's age calculated from the customer profile date of birth database entry.

## 4. Future Features

The following future features could be added in time:

1. Provision of a contact form, giving potential customers another option by which to contact the business.

2. Sending an email to customers when a booking is received.

3. Giving site admin the ability to set booking volume limits for specific lessons or time periods, together with a system that suggests alternatives to customers if a choosen lesson is already booked.

4. The ability to create and save numerous individual profiles within a user account. Allowing several profiles under one customer account, would for example allow a parent to create one account but then create individual profiles and bookings for each family member.

5. Providing a record of progress over time in terms of ability level, attached to each individual profile.

6. The ability to book equipment hire online.

7. The ability to book a broader range of lessons including private lessons with or without equipment hire included.

8. The ability to make payments online.

9. The creation of an online shop for surfing equipment sales.

## 5. Typography and Color Scheme

### 5.1 Typography

The main page heading is also the business name "Kerry Surf School". It has the main surfer hero image as a background and has the font style, Bubblegum Sans. This was chosen for its fun, informal relaxed style and was considered to be very much in keeping with the surfing theme.

All other text uses the Quicksand font style. This style is clear and easy to read while maintaining a somewhat informal look and works well with the Bubblegum Sans heading text.

### 5.2 Color Scheme

As the site is for a surf school it was decided that the appearance of the website should be inspired by sea, surf, sand, and sunshine.

Therefore a color palette consisting of blues, browns, oranges, reds, and purples was considered appropriate.

#7acdf3 is a light blue color and it has been used throughout the website including as the background color for the navigation bar, the footer and a nuber of link buttons. The color fits within the color scheme theme as outlined above and provides a good contrast when reading text.

#3dbcf7 is a slightly darker blue and has been used as the hover color for link buttons. It provides sufficient contrast to the lighter blue above so as to fulfill its function in providing feedback to the user when they hover over a clickable link.

#f1e2d3 is a light brown color and is used as the main background color for the site. It fits within the theme above and contrasts nicely with all other elements on the page.

#620da7 is a rich, deep purple color and has been used for the main page title, the business name, "Kerry Surf School" on larger screens when the title is located to the left of or at the top of the image. The colour is in keeping with the overall theme and provides the required contrast with the background image.

#e9d1d1 is a light orange-pink color and has been used for the main title when it is located towards the bottom of the background image on smaller screens. The location of the surfer within the image on smaller screens requires the title to be displayed toward the bottom of the image. However the purple color #620da7 does not provide sufficient contrast with the color within the background image at this location and so this lighter color is used. Likewise, this lighter color would not provide the required contrast at other locations within the image and therefore the purple color is used as described above.

#d3ccc5 is a brown that provides a small degree of contrast with the main background color and has been used to provide a subtle outline to the booking card on larger screens and to the form and form input fields.

#246bad is a darker blue and has been used to provide a top border to the footer so as to ensure it is always distinguishable even when clickable links and accordion elements with the same background color overlap it.

## 8. Agile Methodology

An Agile methodology and tools have been applied to the management of this project. Tools available within GitHub have been used to apply these methodologies.

The GitHub issues list has been used to create User Stories and Epics as well as raising issues for bugs, testing and UX Enhancement. The issues list for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/issues" target="_blank">here.</a>

Labels have been applied to the issues using both the GitHub-provided labels for bug, enhancement and documentation as well as the creation of custom labels for story points and must-have, should-have, and could-have labels for prioritization.

**Available Labels**

![Screenshot of available lables](documents/labels.png "Available Labels")

Using the milestones feature in GitHub a Product Backlog was created. Issues raised and deemed to require work were passed to the Product Backlog to become Product Backlog Items (PBIs). In the case of this project all issues raised passed to the Product Backlog.

Again using the milestones feature iteration timeboxes were created. For this project the length of a timebox was 5 days and in total 6 iterations were achieved during the development of the MVP. The milestones for this project are available <a href="https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/milestones" target="_blank">here.</a>

Prior to being added to an iteration the acceptance critera for user stories were added and user stories were broken down into the tasks required to achieved the acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria were written in non-technical language to clearly outline what was needed for the user story to be considered fulfilled. The tasks include the technical requirements.

In the case of bugs, testing, and enhancements, a list of tasks required to be completed to address the issue was added.

The tasks and acceptance criteria for any individual task can be viewed by opening the individual issue in the issues list or in the milestone.

Finally, prior to adding any issue to an iteration timebox the appropriate labels were added to assign story points, priority and as necessary hightlight additional information such as the issue being a bug.

The six timebox iterations for the project are as follows:

**Iteration 1**

![Screenshot of iteration one timebox](documents/iteration-one-timebox.png "Iteration One")

**Iteration 2**

![Screenshot of iteration two timebox](documents/iteration-two-timebox.png "Iteration Two")

**Iteration 3**

![Screenshot of iteration three timebox](documents/iteration-three-timebox.png "Iteration Three")

**Iteration 4**

![Screenshot of iteration four timebox](documents/iteration-four-timebox.png "Iteration Four")

**Iteration 5**

![Screenshot of iteration five timebox](documents/iteration-five-timebox.png "Iteration Five")

**Iteration 6**

![Screenshot of iteration six timebox](documents/iteration-six-timebox.png "Iteration Six")

For iterations, 1 to 4, the story point total was set to 8 points. Following the completion of 4 iterations, it was noted that the velocity achieved was closer to 7 story points on average so the total for iteration 5 is seven story points. This was reduced further to 5 points for the final iteration based on a further reduction in average velocity following iteration 5.

When assigning and prioritising PBIs in a timebox, it was ensured that the story-point total for must-have PBIs was set to less than 60% of the total. In practice the percentage was generally much lower than this maximum allowed. It was also ensured that could-have PBIs made up at least 20% of the story-point total.

Finally a kanban board was used to assist in the tracking and coordination of PBIs on a day-to-day basis. This board was set up as a virtual board using the projects tool in GitHub with PBIs added to the board at the commencement of iterations and moving from "Todo" to "In Progress" to "Done". The project board for this project can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/users/fenton1000/projects/5/views/1" target="_blank">here.</a>

**Board at Start**

### 10.3 Fixed Bugs

1. The book now text that appears in the call to action button in the middle of the home page was too big on wider screen sizes.

Solution: An appropriate media query and font-size were applied.

This bug was raised as a PBI within the agile design process. Further information on the bug and solution can be found [here.](https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/issues/20)

2. On the first deployment to Heroku following the addition of the hero image, the hero image did not appear.

Solution: The url to the background image in the styles.css file was updated to be a complete url path to the remote storage location on cloudinary.

This bug was raised as a PBI within the agile design process. Further information on the bug and solution can be found [here.](https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/issues/21)

<details><summary>Fig. 10.3.1 Missing Hero Image</summary>
<img src="documents/missing-hero-image.png"
alt="Screenshot showing the hero image missing from the home page."></details>

3. Initially the booking form accepted dates in the past when booking a lesson.

Solution: A javascript/jquery function was created in date.js to find tomorrow's date and add it to the date input field as a min value attribute.

This bug was raised as a PBI within the agile design process. Further information on the bug and solution can be found [here.](https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/issues/26)

4. In certain input scenarios such as the entry of an invalid height format, the form passed front-end validation, but was returned by the POST method, rendering a new blank form and no feedback on the error.

Solution: The view code was altered so that the creation of the blank form for the get method occurs before the if statement for the POST method. This ensures that should the POST method return an invalid form it is the completed form with errors and not a new blank form. Also the error message tags were added to the form so that the error message is displayed. The front-end messaging was also improved to better explain the required input including the unit of measurement expected.

This bug was raised as a PBI within the agile design process. Further information on the bug and solution can be found [here.](https://github.com/fenton1000/mf-portfolio-four-kerry-surf-school/issues/30)

## 11. Deployment

### 11.1 via GitHub

1. The Code Institute project template was accessed on GitHub at https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template and the Use this Template button clicked to create a project-specific repository.

2. All files and documents pushed from Gitpod appear in the repository.

### 11.2 via Gitpod

The site was developed in Gitpod as follows:

1. From the GitHub repository created for the project the Gitpod button installed as a chrome browser extension was clicked. A Gitpod workspace was created.

2. To view project progress during development the command python3 manage.py runserver was entered in the IDE terminal.

3. At regular appropriate intervals the latest version of the code was saved via the git add and git commit commands. Appropriate commit messages were added to control the revisions.

4. The git push command was used to push all committed code and documentation to the repository for secure storage.

### 11.3 via Heroku

* Prior to deployment to Heroku, the settings.py file is updated to ensure that in the production version debug is set to False.

* Prior to deployment to Heroku, the requirements.txt file is updated by typing the command pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt to the terminal and following this all outstanding commits are pushed to the GitHub repository.

* In Heroku a new project is created to host the application.

* Within this project in the settings section the Config Vars area is updated by adding variables contained locally in the env.py file including the URLs for the database and the Cloudinary storage as well as the django secret key.

* In addition a key named PORT is created and it is given the value 8000.

* In the Deploy section the option to connect to GitHub is chosen, the repository name is found and clicked on.

* The option to deploy from the main branch is chosen and the project is deployed. This may take a few moments.

* Once deployed a button linking to the site is provided. When clicked it leads to the deployed application and the page address can be copied and provided as a link to the site/application.

* The live site/application can be accessed <a href="https://mf-pp4-kerry-surf-school.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>
