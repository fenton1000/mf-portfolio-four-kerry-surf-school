# Portfolio Project 4 - Kerry Surf School README

## 1. Purpose of the Project

Kerry Surf School is a small owner run business teaching surfing lessons and hiring out surfing equipment. The business currently has an online presence via its social media accounts and through a Google Business Profile but it does not have its own website. Most of the surfing lessons are booked over the phone without a requirement to pay when booking. Payments are taken in person on the day of the lesson. Walk-ins are also accepted for lessons if room is available. The majority of equipment hire customers are walk-in customers.

Now the business has decided to create its own website in the hope of increasing business volumes. The business would like to have two key elements initially. Firstly it would like to provide information on the services it currently provides. Secondly it would like to have an option for potential customers to book its most popular beginner-level and intermediate-level lessons online. To begin with, the business is happy to allow customers book online and pay on the day of the lesson as this is how it also manages phone bookings as previously mentioned.

Assuming that the creation of the website leads to benefits for the business, Kerry Surf School would envisage adding additional features to the website over time. These include the ability to book a range of equipment/clothing, to book more advanced lessons with or without equipment and to book private lessons. Futhermore, it would like to eventually have the option to process payments online.

Finally, as a longer term business goal, Kerry Surf School has begun researching the possibility of selling surfing equipment. If it decides at some point in the future to commence equipment sales, it sees online sales as a likely key aspect of such a strategy.
