# Portfolio Project 4 - Kerry Surf School README

## 1. Purpose of the Project

Kerry Surf School is a small owner run business teaching surfing lessons and hiring out surfing equipment. The business currently has an online presence via its social media accounts and through a Google Business Profile but it does not have its own website. Most of the surfing lessons are booked over the phone without a requirement to pay when booking. Payments are taken in person on the day of the lesson. Walk-ins are also accepted for lessons if room is available. The majority of equipment hire customers are walk-in customers.

Now the business has decided to create its own website in the hope of increasing business volumes. The business would like to have two key elements initially. Firstly it would like to provide information on the services it currently provides. Secondly it would like to have an option for potential customers to book its most popular beginner-level and intermediate-level lessons online. To begin with, the business is happy to allow customers book online and pay on the day of the lesson as this is how it also manages phone bookings as previously mentioned.

Assuming that the creation of the website leads to benefits for the business, Kerry Surf School would envisage adding additional features to the website over time. These include the ability to book a range of equipment/clothing, to book more advanced lessons with or without equipment and to book private lessons. Futhermore, it would like to eventually have the option to process payments online.

Finally, as a longer term business goal, Kerry Surf School has begun researching the possibility of selling surfing equipment. If it decides at some point in the future to commence equipment sales, it sees online sales as a likely key aspect of such a strategy.

## 4. Future Features

The following future features could be added in time:

1. The ability to create and save numerous individual profiles within a user account to allow for quicker completion of future bookings. Allowing several profiles under one customer account, would for example allow a parent to create one account but then create individual profiles for each family member.

2. The ability to book equipment hire online.

3. The ability to book a broader range of lessons including private lessons with or without equipment hire included.

4. The ability to make payments online.

5. The creation of an online shop for surfing equipment sales.

## 5. Typography and Color Scheme

### 5.1 Typography

The main page heading is also the business name "Kerry Surf School". It has the main surfer hero image as a background and has the font style Bubblegum Sans. This was chosen for its fun, informal relaxed style and was considered to be very much in keeping with the surfing theme.

All other text uses the Quicksand font-style. This style is clear and easy to read while maintaining a somewhat informal look and works well with the Bubblegum Sans heading text.

### 5.2 Color Scheme

As the site is for a surf school it was decided that the appearance of the website should be inspired by sea, surf, sand, and sunshine.

Therefore a color palette consisting of blues, browns, oranges, reds, and purples was considered appropriate.

#7acdf3 is a light blue color and it has been used throughout the website including as the background color for the navigation bar, the footer and a nuber of link buttons. The color fits within the color scheme theme as outlined above and provides a good contrast when reading text.

#3dbcf7 is a slightly darker blue and has been used as the hover color for link buttons. It provides sufficient contrast to the lighter blue above so as to fulfill its function in providing feedback to the user when they hover over a clickable link.

#f1e2d3 is a light brown color and is used as the main background color for the site. It fits within the theme above and contrasts nicely with all other elements on the page.

#620da7 is a rich, deep purple color and has been used for the main page title, the business name, "Kerry Surf School" on larger screens when the title is located to the left of or at the top of the image. The colour is in keeping with the overall theme and provides the required contrast with the background image.

#e9d1d1 is a light orange-pink color and has been used for the main title when it is located towards the bottom of the background image on smaller screens. The location of the surfer within the image on smaller screens requires the title to be displayed toward the bottom of the image. However the purple color #620da7 does not provide sufficient contrast with the color within the background image at this location and so this lighter color is used. Likewise, this lighter color would not provide the required contrast at other locations within the image and therefore the purple color is used as described above.

#d3ccc5 is a brown that provides a small degree of contrast with the main background color and has been used to provide a subtle outline to the booking card on larger screens and to form input fields.

#246bad is a darker blue and has been used to provide a top border to the footer so as to ensure it is always distinguishable even when clickable links and accordion elements with the same background color overlap it.
